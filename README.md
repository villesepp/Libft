This is my Libft project made in Hive Helsinki (a part of the 42 network (www.42.fr)). I used vim to write the code and some of own tests. Generally speaking, the objective of the project is to replicate the functionality of C standard library and make some similar additional functions as well. 

I have ran the functions through the Francinette (https://github.com/xicodomingues/francinette) testing tool and there were no issues at the time.
