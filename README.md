ðŸŽ¯ This is my Libft project made in Hive Helsinki (a part of the 42 network (www.42.fr)). I used vim to write the code and some of my own tests. Generally speaking, the objective of the project is to mimic the functionality of some of C standard library functions and make some other additional and useful functions as well. This library will be used in future projects as well.

âœ… I have ran the functions through the Francinette (https://github.com/xicodomingues/francinette) testing tool and there were no issues at the time. I had added some protections for some crashes, but since those are not included in the standard functions, I opted to remove those to get a passing mark on the testing tool.

âœ… Other testing tools I used were https://github.com/alelievr/libft-unit-test and https://github.com/Tripouille/libftTester.

âœ… "Norminette", the tool that we use to check whether the code is written as per the style guidelines says everything is 'OK!'

âœ… Project was passed with 125/100 points (incl. bonuses).

âž• Functions added later: atoll, isspace, arr_free, is_number.

ðŸ˜‡ TODO: strjoin should return a string if either of the strings are valid i(strdup(thegoodstring))
