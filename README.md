This is my Libft project made in Hive Helsinki (a part of the 42 network (www.42.fr)). I used vim to write the code and some of my own tests. Generally speaking, the objective of the project is to replicate the functionality of C standard library and make some similar additional functions as well. 

✅ I have ran the functions through the Francinette (https://github.com/xicodomingues/francinette) testing tool and there were no issues at the time. I had actually added some protections for some crashes, but since those are not included in the standard functinons, I opted to remove those to get passing mark on the testing tool.

✅ "Norminette", the tool that we use to check whether the code is written as per the style guidelines says everything is 'OK!'
